**Arithmetic Operators:**

   In python we can use +,-,*,**,/,% these operators for calculation.

          ("+":Addition,"-":Subtraction,"*":Multiplication, "**":Power,"/
          ":Division,"%":Remainder)

**Assignment Operator:** If we want to assign the value to variable then we use "=".

       Ex. a=10


**Data Types In Python:**

     1. Numeric:
                Integer     : -8,-4,0,1,2
                Float       : The numbers which are in deciamal form.   
                              Ex. 23,6.7, etc,.
                Complex No. : It is a combination of real and imaginary  
                              part. Ex. 3+8j where real part=3 and 
                              imaginary part=8

    2. Text: In python the sequence of characters enclosed by " ",' ' is 
             called as string. Ex. var_x="Python"
             String literals can span multiple lines."""...""" or '''...'''

             We can concatenate the string by using "+" operator.
             And to repeat the string we use "*" operator.

    3. List: List is an ordered collection of multiple elements either 
             the same or different data types in [].
             Ex. lst=[1,2,"Python",(4,5,6)]

**Indexing & Slicing**:

      Indexing allows us to access the individual element from data 
      structures like list,string,tuple,etc,.
      Ex. a="Python"
          a[1]
      
      Slicing allows us to access the portion of sequence.
      Ex. b='1Enine'
          b[1:]


We can measure the length of an iterable data type by using len() function.
